# generator-express-webapp [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/diogobeda/generator-express-webapp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/diogobeda/generator-express-webapp)

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Why?

A friend of mine asked me to share the architecture of the node app I'm currently building. So I decided to make a yeoman generator. I don't think it's the best architecture, but it's what I could came up for now.

## Tutorial

`$(sudo) npm install -g yo
$(sudo) npm install -g generator-express-webapp
$yo express-webapp`
